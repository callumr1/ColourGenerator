Colour! Generator is a simple static site that I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some jQuery. Colour! generates a random colour and sets the sites background to that colour. It then displays the Hex and RGB codes for the colour allowing the user to copy them. The idea itself has been done before but I wanted to try my hand at it and test out some design ideas I had.

I originally wanted to exclusively use JavaScript for this project as I had been using mainly jQuery in work projects. However, there were a few functions that I had become used to using from jQuery like `.ready()`. When a colour is generated, both the hex code and rgb code for that colour are then displayed to allow users to copy the colour and use in their own projects.

Here are some ideas I thought of developing for Colour! Generator:
 - Convert a colour that the user entered
 - Support more colour types (e.g. CMYK)
